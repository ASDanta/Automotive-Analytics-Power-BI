Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing **428 car models** to uncover insights on pricing, performance, fuel efficiency, and real vehicle value.

## Project Overview
This project answers key questions using data visualization and DAX:
- Where does the price premium come from? (Europe vs Asia vs America)
- Which makes deliver the most horsepower — and at what fuel cost?
- How does DriveTrain affect MPG (City vs Highway)?
- Is there a clear link between engine size and horsepower?
- Which brands offer the **best value**? (custom Value Score metric)

**Data Source:** Kaggle Cars Dataset (428 models)  
**Tools & Skills Used:**
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)
- DAX (custom measures like Value Score)
- Interactive slicers & filters
- Visuals: KPI cards, gauge, scatter with trend line, clustered bars, donut, horizontal bars

## Key Insights
- **Pricing gap**: European cars average ~$44K MSRP vs Asian cars ~$23K
- **Power leaders**: Porsche (~321 HP), Hummer, Jaguar, Cadillac, Infiniti — but combined MPG averages just 23.45
- **DriveTrain impact**: Rear-wheel = best highway (25 MPG); All-wheel = lowest overall (17 city / 20 highway)
- **Value Score winner** (HP + Combined MPG normalized by price): **Saturn** tops the list, followed by Suzuki & Toyota
- **Strong correlation**: Larger engine size → higher horsepower (clear trend across types)
  
## Improvements & Learnings
- Added data labels and clearer tooltips in future versions.
- Planning to publish interactive version to Power BI Service (will add link here).
- Great practice in DAX, storytelling, and turning data into business insights.
